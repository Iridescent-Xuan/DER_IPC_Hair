# Hair Simulation with DER and IPC

## DER 

For **curly** hair, you may well reset the parameters as `ks_ = 3e3`, `kb_ = 6e-3`, `kt_ = 1e-2` (as is given in `test/Curly` and `test/CurlyGravity`).

I tried hard to adjust the parameters, but still the curly hair would be stretched straight gradually under gravity. Maybe a damping force is needed...
